Experiment 2: Ganache Setup and Custom RPC Network Configuration
Aim

To configure Ganache, create a custom RPC network in MetaMask, connect it with Ganache, and transfer Ether between Ganache accounts.

Tools Required

Ganache (Desktop)

MetaMask Extension

Web Browser

Remix IDE (optional)

Procedure
Step 1: Start Ganache

Open Ganache.

Click Quickstart (Ethereum).

Ganache generates:

Local blockchain

Multiple accounts

Preloaded Ether balances

Step 2: Configure Custom RPC Network in MetaMask

Open MetaMask → Add Network → Custom RPC.

Enter the following details:

Field	Value
Network Name	Ganache Local
RPC URL	http://127.0.0.1:7545
Chain ID	1337
Currency Symbol	ETH

Click Save and connect to the network.

Step 3: Import Ganache Account into MetaMask

Copy the Private Key from Ganache.

Open MetaMask → Import Account.

Paste the private key and import.

Ganache account balance will reflect in MetaMask.

Step 4: Transfer Ether Between Ganache Accounts

Select the imported Ganache account.

Enter another Ganache account address.

Transfer ETH and confirm.

Transaction appears instantly due to local blockchain.

Important Notes

Ganache runs on a local blockchain, so transactions work only on the same system.

Public test networks like Sepolia allow transactions across different machines.

Ganache uses a local RPC server (127.0.0.1).

Result

MetaMask was successfully connected to Ganache using a custom RPC network, and Ether transfer between Ganache accounts was completed.

Conclusion

MetaMask allows interaction with both public test networks and local blockchains. Ganache provides a fast and secure environment for testing Ethereum transactions and smart contracts without real Ether.
